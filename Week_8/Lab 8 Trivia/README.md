# Trivia
A simple trivia game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice and free-response questions and displays the results in real-time. This program was completed as part of the CS50 course offered by Harvard University.

## Getting Started
To run this program, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You can answer the trivia questions provided by clicking on the answer buttons and typing your responses in the input field.

## Background
This project was created as a part of the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. The objective was to design a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to let users answer trivia questions.

## Implementation Details
The trivia game consists of two parts:

### Part 1: Multiple Choice
This part displays a multiple-choice trivia question with four possible answers. If the user selects the correct answer, the button will turn green, and a message will be displayed indicating that the answer is correct. If the user selects an incorrect answer, the button will turn red, and a message will be displayed indicating that the answer is incorrect.

### Part 2: Free Response
This part displays a free-response trivia question. The user can enter their answer in the input field and confirm it by clicking the "Submit" button. If the user types the correct answer, the input field will turn green, and a message will be displayed indicating that the answer is correct. If the user types an incorrect answer, the input field will turn red, and a message will be displayed indicating that the answer is incorrect.

## Example Usage
To use the trivia game, open the index.html file in a web browser. Then, follow these steps:

- Read the question carefully.
- Select the answer you believe is correct by clicking on the corresponding button (Part 1) or typing your response in the input field and clicking the "Submit" button (Part 2).
