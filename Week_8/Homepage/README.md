# Homepage
This project is a website that contains four different HTML pages: index.html, about.html, contact.html, and services.html. The website has been designed to meet the following specifications:

The website allows the user to navigate to any page from any other page by clicking on hyperlinks.
The website uses more than ten distinct HTML tags besides the basic ones, such as <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>.
The website uses Bootstrap library to enhance its appearance, by including at least one feature from Bootstrapâ€™s components.
The website includes a custom stylesheet called styles.css that uses at least five different CSS selectors and five different CSS properties.
The website integrates one or more features of JavaScript to make it more interactive.

## Getting Started
To use this project, you can clone or download the files from the GitHub repository. Once you have the files on your local machine, you can run http-server to see how the site looks while you work on it. You can command-click on the first link presented by http-server, which should open your webpage in a new tab. You can then refresh the tab containing your webpage to see your latest changes.

## Background
This project was created as part of the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. The goal of the project was to create a website that met specific criteria, such as using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive website that looked good on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Implementation Details
The project consists of five main files:

- index.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- services.html
- styles.css
  
The index.html file is the main page of the website and contains links to the other pages. The other pages provide additional information about the website and its services.

The styles.css file contains custom CSS styles for the website. It uses five different CSS selectors, such as tag, class, and ID selectors, and five different CSS properties, such as font-size and margin.

The website also includes Bootstrap library, which has been used to enhance the appearance of the website by including a navigation bar.

The website also uses JavaScript to make it more interactive. For example, it includes a script that displays an alert message when the user clicks on a button.

## Example Usage
To use this project, you can open any of the HTML files in your web browser. From the index.html page, you can click on the links to navigate to other pages of the website. You can also interact with the website by clicking on buttons or other elements that have been made interactive using JavaScript.
