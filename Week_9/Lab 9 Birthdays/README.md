# Birthdays

## Getting Started
This project is a simple web application that allows you to add birthdays and display them on a table. To get started with the project, you need to follow the instructions below:

- Clone the repository.
- Install the necessary dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application: flask run
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

## Background
This program was completed as part of the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. The goal of this project was to build a web application that allows users to add and view birthdays.

## Implementation Details
This project was implemented using Flask, a lightweight web application framework in Python. The database used is SQLite, and the code uses the CS50 library to interact with it.

## Example Usage
Once you have followed the above steps to start the application, you can use it to add and view birthdays. To add a birthday, go to the home page and fill in the form with the person's name, birth month, and birth day. Click on the "Add Birthday" button to submit the form, and the birthday will be added to the database.

To view all birthdays, go to the home page and scroll down to the "All Birthdays" section. The table shows all the birthdays that have been added to the database.
