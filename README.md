# CS50 Labs and Problem Sets
Welcome to my CS50 repository! Here, you'll find some of the labs and problem sets challenges I completed while attending the popular computer science course from Harvard University.

## Overview
The repository is organized by weeks, and each week contains several programming challenges that range from basic "Hello World" programs to more complex projects. The following is a summary of the projects contained in each week:

**Week 1:** This week covers the basics of programming in C, and includes programs to validate credit card numbers, calculate population growth, and print various patterns like Mario's pyramid.

**Week 2:** Here, you'll find programs that explore topics such as encryption, string manipulation, and reading and writing files. These challenges include a substitution cipher program, a Scrabble-like game, and a program to calculate the readability of a given text.

**Week 3:** This week focuses on algorithms and data structures, and includes challenges to implement various sorting algorithms, a program to simulate a plurality vote election, and a program to implement the Tideman voting algorithm.

**Week 4:** In this week, you'll learn about image manipulation and memory allocation in C. Challenges include programs to manipulate images, colorize grayscale images, and recover JPEGs from a forensic image.

**Week 5:** Here, you'll explore topics such as file I/O and data structures. Challenges include programs to simulate genetic inheritance of blood types, and a spell checker that uses a hash table.

**Week 6:** This week includes a set of programming challenges in Python. Projects include a DNA identification program, a tournament simulator, and Python versions of some of the earlier C challenges like the credit program and the "Hello World" and Mario pyramid programs.

**Week 7:** This was about web development and build web applications using Flask, a popular Python web framework. Projects include Fiftyville, a web app to track the 50 US states' COVID-19 vaccination status, and applications to add, list, and search for songs and movies in a database.

**Week 8:** This week is all about front-end web development, and includes a project to create a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also had to create a trivia game that quizzes players on various topics.

**Week 9:** In the final week, we combine our knowledge of web development and databases to create a web app called Finance, a simple stock trading platform. Also created an app that stores and displays information about friends' birthdays.

### Getting Started
To access any of the programs listed above, simply navigate to the relevant week's folder and open the corresponding file in your preferred text editor. You'll find detailed instructions and requirements for each challenge in the README files included in each folder.

### Conclusion
I hope you find this repository informative and useful in assessing my programming skills. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me via email or through my GitHub profile. Thanks for stopping by!
